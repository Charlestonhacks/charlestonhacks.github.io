            <p><b>harborHack</b> is a community-run hackathon in Charleston, South Carolina. It is co-hosted by the College of Charleston at the Harbor Walk East and West buildings, located at the beautiful Charleston harbor. harborHack is a dynamic event where individuals from different backgrounds and skill levels work together to develop solutions to real-world problems.</p>
            <p><b> What is a Hackathon? </b> A hackathon is like a brainstorming and creation marathon. You bring your ideas, we provide the network, venue, awards and prizes, and together, we create tech projects that are something to be proud of. Think mobile or web apps, software and tech solutions to real-world problems. After a concentrated but fun-filled weekend, you'll have a working prototype to show off and be the envy of the community, and perhaps win an award and prize. You will also have met and worked with the best people you will ever meet.</p>
            <p><b>Team Formation: </b>At the beginning of the in-person event, participants will form groups of 2-5 people who want to work together on a project that is suggested by a team member and will begin hacking the following day. Teams can begin forming before the hack either in person or using the tools within Devpost, but don't worry, we will help everyone find a team on opening night! Awards and prizes await the best of the best, but the biggest reward is the experience itself.</p>
            <p><b>Register: </b>This event is for 80-100 awesome individuals to come together to learn something valuable, make a new network of friends all while having fun and helping Charleston rise as a tech hub. Registrants include software developers, designers, business professionals, subject matter experts, entrepreneurs, students, and people who have an interest in technology, innovation, and social impact. So, don't miss out ‚Äì join the hackathon party, and let's make some digital magic happen! üöÄüíªüèÜ</p>
