								<p>Summer Hack harnesses the positive potential of our participants to focus on greater good of our community by using new tools like generative AI. Competitors join us for two unforgettable five-hour hacking sessions collaborating and with their teams. 
									</p>

Unlock the potential of technology across diverse domains and address complex challenges, be it in healthcare, education, environmental conservation, and beyond. This is your opportunity to unleash your creativity, sharpen critical thinking and problem-solving skills,
									and explore new ideas with the latest technology to contribute to the good of society!.</p>

								<p><b>Connect:</b> Collaborate on a project with our community of technologists, creatives, professionals, and students from diverse backgrounds and skill levels and create meaningful connections and expand your professional network.</p>

								<p><b>Learn:</b> Come together with teams that possess the foundational knowledge to generate extraordinary ideas, develop remarkable applications, and explore the realm of cutting-edge technologies. Expand your understanding of a technology and acquire invaluable experience in harnessing its potential.</p>

								<pThe Charlestonhacks Summer Hack event brings together individuals from diverse backgrounds and skill sets, creating an inspiring environment to collaborate and develop innovative solutions to a specific problem. Our mission is to educate, empower, and enable individuals to join or grow their careers in the local tech industry 
									and connect with likeminded builders.</p>
								
								<p>Charleston Summer Hacks are held on 3 separate days in the summer:

								Each of the two events are separate hackathons and competitors work on separate projects, so if schedules don't allow you to make both, just join the one you can!</p>

								<p><b>The Charleston Digital Corridor (CDC)</b> is a community-sourced initiative to attract, nurture and promote the region's tech economy through an array of impactful programs, products and events while leveraging Charleston's
								renowned livability.The CDC is focused on creating the business, education and social environment that is attractive to tech and tech-related companies. Then, the CDC leverages its carefully nurtured relationships,
								program elements, legislative access, and contacts to assist companies with integrating them into community. This integration is accomplished through four pillars...COMMUNITY, TALENT, SPACES & CAPITAL.
								The Digital Corridor was the venue for our Summerhacks hackathon in June 2023 </p>
