                <p><b>"I attended my first hackathon almost 2 years ago. I wondered if leaving my family for a weekend and competing at one of the most prestigious academic institutions in the world was a good idea.

Team formation night at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Reality Hack was where things got serious. I spent hours at the MIT Media Lab trying to convince people to join my team and work on an application for Qualcomm's new augmented reality glasses. I wanted to turn ordinary people into actors in a giant immersive mystery.

When the night was over, I walked across the windy, freezing cold bridge back to Copley Square, feeling a strange sense of self-doubt and regret. My mind was racing, and I couldn't stop thinking about what I had gotten myself into. Why did I think I could compete in a hackathon with so little experience? Should I just take the next flight home or stay a couple more days walking around Boston, obsessing about how I didnâ€™t have the guts to continue down this path?

I didn't sleep, and in the morning, I grabbed my laptop, drank too much coffee, and walked to MIT. This turned out to be one of those important decisions that you make, jumping in with both feet, not knowing where you will land.

I discovered a lot about myself that day: commit to something and do whatever you can to be of service. I got to see the good in people and was rewarded for going outside my comfort zone. I understood the value of a team.

Did we win? No. But by the time the event was over, I had made new friends and helped create something I believed in. I also was not the same person that I was before this event. I now knew what I had to do." This was one of our founders experiences when he went to his first hackathon. 

ChalestonHacks is about self discovery, connecting to other people and building something that you belive it. It all started because we jumped in with both feet, extended ourselves and pushed through to the other side. 

Our theme of HarborHack 2024 is digital transformation. Harness your skills to challenge yourself to develop solutions that change the existing way we do things.</p>
                <p><b>Your idea</b> - What is your projects mission? Is it focused on the environment, or business, education, equality, health, creativity or a combination that 
                    hasn't been conceived of yet?</p>
