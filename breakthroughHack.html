                <p><b>About the challenge:
"I was a remote worker for 15+ years and was laid off during Covid. Most of my career involved talking with co-workers who were hundreds, if not thousands, of miles away. I didn't know the people in the town where I live, and my work experience was in an industry that doesn't really exist in Charleston.

Having little success in finding a new job, I decided to learn something new. I took a course in XR development by XR Terra. This class set me on a path that I am still on to this day.

The path led me to a large multi-day event at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology called the MIT Reality Hack. When I arrived, I immediately connected with some of the most amazing people I have ever met. I was fascinated and also intimidated by them. Imposter syndrome started to kick in hard, and I wondered if leaving my family for four days and competing in an in-person hackathon at one of the most prestigious academic institutions in the world was a good idea.

Team formation night was where things got serious. I spent hours at the MIT Media Lab trying to convince people to join my team and work on an application for Qualcomm's new augmented reality glasses. I wanted to turn ordinary people into actors in a giant immersive mystery.

The idea was, dare I say, ambitious, especially since I wasn't a developer and would need lots of tech help to pull it off. Various potential teammates came and went. I gave up several times and started to walk back to my Airbnb. It was 1am when I returned to the Media Lab, deciding that I was going to join another team and hoped I could add value in some way and not let my teammates down.

When the night was over, I walked across the windy, freezing cold bridge back to Copley Square, feeling a strange sense of self-doubt and regret. My mind was racing, and I couldn't stop thinking about what I had gotten myself into. Why did I think I could compete in a hackathon with so little experience? Should I just take the next flight home or stay a couple more days walking around Boston, obsessing about how I didnâ€™t have the guts to continue down this path?

I didn't sleep, and in the morning, I grabbed my laptop, drank too much coffee, and walked to MIT. This turned out to be one of those important decisions that you make, jumping in with both feet, not knowing where you will land.

I discovered a lot about myself that day: commit to something and do whatever you can to be of service. I got to see the good in people and was rewarded for going outside my comfort zone. I understood the value of a team.

Did we win? No. But by the time the event was over, I had made new friends and helped create something I believed in. I also was not the same person that I was before this event. I now knew what I had to do." This was one of our founders experiences when he went to his first hackathon. 

ChalestonHacks was born from self discovery, connecting to other people and building something. What will you build? 

Our theme of HarborHack 2024 is digital transformation. Harness your skills to challenge yourself to develop solutions that change the existing way we do things.

and watch the video: TBD

But remember, we all started somewhere, so jump in with both feet. Great things await you!</p>
